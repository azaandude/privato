# NAME-O-MATIC 9000 — Football Platform

A full football simulation platform: real player database, career/manager sims, mini-games, and social features. Everything runs as static HTML/JS — **no backend, no server, no build step**. Host the whole folder anywhere that serves static files (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any web host) and it works.

## ⚠️ Setup — read this first

1. **Upload every file below into the same folder.** Nothing works in isolation — almost every page loads `database.js` directly, and the hub pages link to each other by filename.
2. **Don't just double-click the HTML files locally.** Some features (loading `database.js`, custom 3D models) use browser APIs that are blocked on the `file://` protocol for security reasons. You need a real HTTP server — GitHub Pages is free and takes about two minutes to set up.
3. **`app.html` is large (~640KB).** That's normal — it's the main hub with 25+ tabs built into one file.

## 🔗 How the linking works

Every page's navigation is hardcoded by filename — `index.html`'s shop grid and quick-links sidebar, and `app.html`'s tab bar and Quick Start modal, both link to every file listed above. As long as filenames aren't changed and everything sits in one folder, nothing needs reconfiguring.

## 📊 Data freshness

`database.js` includes a `meta` object with a `lastFullReview` date and per-league verification timestamps (`window.NOMDB.meta`). `database.html` displays this on load. Squad data doesn't update itself — there's no backend to do that automatically. To refresh any league, ask Claude in a new chat to re-verify it; that's exactly how Portugal, Eredivisie, Brazil, Mexico, and the Women's Super League got added mid-session.

## 🌍 Current database scope

- **22 leagues**: Premier League, Championship, League One/Two, Scottish Premiership/Championship/League One/League Two (England + Scotland full pyramids), La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Eredivisie, Primeira Liga, Brasileirão, Liga Profesional (Argentina), Liga MX, MLS, Saudi Pro League, J1 League, Women's Super League, Egyptian Premier League
- **71 national teams** across UEFA, CONMEBOL, CONCACAF, AFC, CAF
- **1408 players listed** across **318 clubs**. Only **31 clubs** have a full squad (11+ players). Most clubs have only a handful of players, so the database is far from complete. See the coverage table below.
- **Known gap**: Oceania has no domestic league yet, and Africa is covered by Egypt only so far. Ask to have a specific league added if it matters to you.

## 🐛 Known limitations (stated plainly)

- No real backend — all progress (career saves, pack collections, quiz streaks) is stored in **your browser's localStorage**, per-device, per-browser. Clearing browser data erases it.
- Squad data is manually researched and verified per-league, not pulled from a live sports API — see "Data freshness" above.
- Most clubs have only a handful of players. Lower divisions (League One/Two in England, Scottish League One/Two and the Scottish Championship) have club names and stadiums but no player squads yet.
- Player ratings (ovr, pac, sho and so on) are estimates, not official ratings. Squad names come from research, not a live feed, so they can be out of date.

## Running offline

Everything here works with no connection after the first visit: the service worker (`sw.js`) caches every page and asset, and `fonts/` and `vendor/` hold the fonts and Three.js locally.

- **Works offline:** all single-player games, the database, Trophy Cabinet, Manager Mode, Transfer Market, Referee Career, Career Mode, Fantasy, Packs, Radio, Quiz, Tactics, Penalty Shootout, Kit Lab, Matchday Bingo, Football Hangman and the 3D pages.
- **Needs internet:** sign-in and cloud saves (`login.html`), community chat (`community.html`), online multiplayer (`multiplayer.html`), the AI Connect page and the AI features in `app.html`. These show a clear message offline; the rest of the site still works.
- Service workers need the site served over `http://localhost` or `https://`. Opening the files straight from disk (`file://`) skips the offline cache.
- Clearing site data removes the cache and your saved progress. Each page updates its cache on the next online visit.

## Adding real squads (tools/import-squads.js)

The importer puts squads into `database.js` from a CSV you provide. It doesn't fetch data itself.

```
node tools/import-squads.js template champ      # CSV skeleton with the league's club names
node tools/import-squads.js check   my.csv      # validate only
node tools/import-squads.js apply   my.csv      # dry run: shows what would change
node tools/import-squads.js apply   my.csv --write   # save (a database.js.bak backup is made first)
node tools/import-squads.js coverage            # per-league coverage report
```

- Columns: `league,club,name,pos,age,nat,ovr,pac,sho,pas,dri,def,phy`. `ovr` and the stats are optional. If you leave them blank, the player is marked `est:1` and the stats are estimates.
- A club's squad is replaced by the rows given for it. The dry run shows how many existing players would be dropped, so check that before you use `--write`.
- Nationality uses ISO codes such as `GB-ENG`, `GB-SCT`, `NL`, `IE`.
- Ages and nationalities should come from a source you're allowed to use. The tool doesn't check them against the internet.
